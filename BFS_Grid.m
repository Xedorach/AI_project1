% BFS function that is applied to input grid. 
% Takes following Arguments: MAP
%                            Start point
%                            Goal Point
%                            DrawMapEverytime

% Gives following outputs:   Path to goal cell

% Color Code:               GREEN   : Start point
%                           YELLOW  : Goal Point
%                           RED     : Explored
%                           BLUE    : To be Explored (in the frontier)
%                           BLACK   : Obstacle
%                           WHITE   : Empty space
